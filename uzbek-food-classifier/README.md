# Uzbek Food Classifier 🇺🇿🍽️

A simple image classification project using PyTorch that can classify three traditional Uzbek dishes: **plov**, **shashlik**, and **somsa**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a small deep learning project built for practice and portfolio purposes. The goal is to classify images of Uzbek food using a custom CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) trained from scratch on a small dataset collected and labeled manually.

## 📂 Dataset

- Total classes: `3` (osh, kabob, manti)
- ~130 images per class
- All images converted to `.jpg`
- Stored in `train/` and `test/` folders with subfolders for each class
